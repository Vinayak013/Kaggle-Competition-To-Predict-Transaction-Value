# Kaggle-Competition-To-Predict-Transaction-Value
1) Problem Statement:-
        Anonamized data for predicting value of the customer's transaction. 
2) Model structure :-
        1)  As each data sample had 4K+ featurs, so used Autoencoder and PCA (in seprate submissions)to compress number of features.
        2)  So the model is Encoder - Dense Layer Network to predict target. 
        3) Included are the Python code for training Autoencoder and then final model to predict ustomer Transaction Value and PCA.
3) Results :-
        Submission trained with above model got the score of 1.65.
4) Data for this model can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-value-prediction-challenge/data
